# Redbot - Discord Voice Bot

## Project Setup

This project uses:
- **pnpm** (primary) for package management and scripts
- **mise** (optional) for environment and task management
- **TypeScript** for development
- **trunk** for code quality checks

## Development Workflow

### Task Management

Preferred (pnpm direct):
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm build` - Build the project
- `pnpm dev` - Run in development mode
- `pnpm test` - Run tests

Optional (mise tasks, if desired):
- `mise tasks` - List available tasks
- `mise pnpm-install` - Install dependencies
- `mise pnpm-build` - Build the project
- `mise pnpm-dev` - Run in development mode
- `mise pnpm-test` - Run tests

### Code Quality
- **trunk check** is enabled for pre-commit hooks
- If pre-commit hooks fail, document issues in `@scratchpads-logs/`

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Discord.js** with @discordjs/voice for Discord integration
- **Deepgram SDK** for both speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **E2B Code Interpreter** for sandboxed code execution
- **Obsidian Local REST API** for vault integration
- **Zellij/tmux** for terminal pane management
- **Carapace** for shell completion specs

### Voice Pipeline
- Continuous listening (no push-to-talk)
- Deepgram Voice Agent integration with Discord.js
- Real-time STT → LLM → TTS pipeline
- Target latency: < 2 seconds end-to-end

### Data Sources
- **Obsidian Clippings**: Weekly clippings from `/Clippings/` subdirectory
- **LLM**: OpenAI or Anthropic for conversation and code generation
- **Sandboxed Execution**: E2B for running user code safely

### Terminal Integration
- **Glow**: Simple CLI execution in Zellij/tmux panes
- **Pane Management**: Automated layout creation and labeling
- **CLI Generation**: Go Cobra tools with Carapace completions

## Implementation Priority

1. **MVP**: Discord voice bot with continuous listening
2. **Core**: Obsidian weekly clippings integration
3. **Enhanced**: Terminal glow integration for markdown display
4. **Advanced**: Code execution and CLI generation

## Notes

- Manual muting preferred over push-to-talk implementation
- Clippings are pre-filtered by date in Obsidian vault structure
- Simple glow integration - just execute CLI in terminal panes
- Deepgram Voice Agent provides integrated STT/TTS pipeline
